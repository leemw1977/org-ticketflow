# Welcome to org-ticketflow
This package has been designed to link up with your ticket systems.

The first system will be Jira because that is what my company is using, but I could see this being used for GitHub too.

It aims to provide that bridge between the ticketing system and Org mode in Emacs, so you can remain in your familiar environment but still keep your stakeholders happy.
